    <p>There’s nothing like taking the day to head to a football game. The drive to the stadium, seeing as the magnificent construction grows larger and larger on the horizon. The atmosphere and ambiance at each NFL stadium are entirely unique. It’s a whole new culture no matter where fans choose to go. But when standing outside of these fields, very few fans understand where the money to build this facility even came from.<p>The financing of NFL stadiums has been a topic of great interest in recent years, with many new stadiums being built or planned around the league. There are several different approaches to financing these major projects, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.
    <p>One approach is for the team and the league to finance the stadium themselves. This can be done through loans, bonds, and private investment. The advantage of this approach is that the team and league have more control over the design and construction of the stadium, and they can make sure that it meets the specific needs and requirements of the team. However, there is also a risk involved in this approach, as the team and league are responsible for paying back any loans or bonds, taking a chance that the stadium may not generate enough revenue to cover these costs. <p>

<p>The New England Patriots’ Gillette Stadium is one of the three NFL stadiums built without any use of public funding. However, the New England owners cheated their way to this one a bit. While they did cover the full $325 million to construct Gillette Stadium, the state of Massachusetts paid $72 million for road, sewer, and other infrastructure improvements around the site. This all came about because the Patriots had an offer from Hartford, Connecticut to build a $374 million stadium at no cost to New England and its owners.
  <p>Another option is to partner with local governments to finance the stadium. This can be done through tax breaks, public funding, and other incentives. The advantage of this approach is that it helps to spread the financial burden of the stadium across a larger group of stakeholders, and it can also generate additional economic development and revenue for the local community. They can generate new jobs and revenue through the construction process, and they can also bring in additional tourism and business through events held at the stadium. However, there may be controversy surrounding this approach. Some argue that these facilities primarily benefit wealthy team owners and corporations, rather than the public. They may also question whether the economic benefits of a new stadium are as significant as proponents claim, or whether they are outweighed by the costs to taxpayers. In addition, there may be other priorities that local governments could choose to fund with public money, such as education, infrastructure, or social services.
    <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Raymond James Stadium is the only NFL stadium funded entirely by the public. According to the Buffalo News, Hillsborough County voters in 1996 approved a half-cent increase in the sales tax for 30 years to pay off the cost of the publicly funded stadium. The owners of the Bucs had threatened to move if they didn’t get a new stadium. A former Tampa mayor had argued the use of the sales tax money for a new facility wasn’t legal, but his court challenge didn’t succeed.<p>A third approach is to finance the stadium through a combination of private and public funding, this is what most NFL stadiums end up utilizing. This can involve a mix of loans, bonds, and other forms of private financing, as well as public funding and incentives. The advantage of this approach is that it allows for greater flexibility and customization, as the team and league can work with local governments and other stakeholders to come up with a financing plan that meets the needs of all parties involved. However, this approach can also be complex, as it requires the negotiation of multiple agreements and the balancing of a variety of competing interests.
      <p>When looking at the financing for these stadiums, it can also be interesting to see how affordable games are for fans to attend. Stadiums like the Buccaneers’ would perhaps be more affordable considering the public financed the entire stadium. While stadiums that didn’t use any public help would be on the pricier side to help bring back some money. However, that’s not always the case.<p>
<h2>Spending the day at an NFL Stadium</h2>
<p>Tampa Bay’s Raymond James Stadium mentioned earlier cost about $325 million dollars of public money to construct. Yet, when looking at the most expensive games to attend in 2021, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers rank second in the priciest teams. Taking the cost of two tickets, a couple of drinks, and two hotdogs, it costs about $475 dollars to attend a game. So, why aren’t we seeing Tampa owners cut the public a break?.</p>

<p>“The Bucs are capitalizing right now on the fact that they have Tom Brady and a recent Super Bowl championship,” says Michael Mondello, associate program director of the Vinik Sport & Entertainment Management Program at the University of South Florida located just 11 miles from Raymond James Stadium. “My guess is that ticket prices will drop across the board at most levels next year after he retires. The organization capitalized on the timing of having a competitive team and a marquee player.”<p>So, when teams don’t have a once-in-a-generation type talent or a recent championship ring, ticket prices are all driven by supply and demand according to Mondello.<p>

<p>“Many teams will price their tickets at the beginning of the season expecting certain games to be a premium and other games to be a discount but sometimes they miss,” noted Mondello. “For example, the Bucs thought their schedule would set up nicely with some of the marquee games they originally had slated, but that turned out to be not the case,” said Mondello pointing to a matchup with the Super Bowl defending champs, the Los Angeles Rams, who are just 4-9 on the season.<p>Overall, the financing of NFL stadiums is a complex and multifaceted issue, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Teams and leagues must carefully consider a range of factors, including their own financial resources, the needs and preferences of their local communities, and the potential risks and benefits of different financing approaches. The goal is to find a financing plan that allows for the construction of high-quality, state-of-the-art stadiums that provide an enjoyable experience for fans, while also being financially sustainable in the long term.<p>
